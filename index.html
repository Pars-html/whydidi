        <br>
        <p style="color: white;">
            I started programming because
             my mom said that it would help getting a job.
        </p>
        <p style="color: white;">
            So,she signed me up for a python course.
        </p>
        <p style="color: white;">
            But I didn't really care about it that much.
        </p>
        <p style="color: white;">
            Ya'know,I was around 8 years old at that time.
        </p>
        <p style="color: white;">
            You can go to Youtube and look for a eight year
             old that wants to code.
        </p>
        <p style="color: white;">
            What I'm trying to say is
             barely anybody cares about coding especially 
             when they're young (5-12).
        </p>
        <br>
        <p style="color: white;">
            But then,something just snapped out of me.
        </p>
        <p style="color: white;">
            Our computer teacher said that we were going
            to start coding.
        </p>
        <p style="color: white;">
            I was like "Pff,I got this!
        </p>
        <p style="color: white;">
            I have been having classes since forever!"
        </p>
        <p style="color: white;">
            But then I realised that I remember almost
        </p>
        <p style="color: white;">
            nothing since I wasn't paying any attention.
        </p>
        <p style="color: white;">
            So,I started from scratch since then.
        </p>

        </p>
        <p style="color: white;">
            continue to program while

        <p style="color: white;">
            knowing that nobody cares.
